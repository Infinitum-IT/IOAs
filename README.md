As InfinitumIT, we continue to develop our projects to provide the best service to our customers and the most support to the communities.

We offer Indicator of Attack (IOA) detected by our MDR, Red Team and Blue Team teams in 3 different formats; json, xml, txt, which you can easily integrate into your products via our Github page. ðŸš¥

As it is known, IOAs are signs that an attack is actively happening or about to happen. They usually focus on attack behavior and can help detect attacks in their early stages.
